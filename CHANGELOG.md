# CHANGELOG

This change log is written in descending order. Changes that happen after version
`X` was released, are written *above* that version number, because they will be
included in the (note yet determined) next version number.

**Development version**

- Enable support for network-based public transport simulation by setting `eqasim.useScheduleBasedTransport` to `false` (it is activated by default)

**1.1.0**

- Cutter: Cut transit routes with only *one* stop are not included anymore
- `ModularUtilityEstimator` -> `ModalUtilityEstimator`
- Removed `UniversalTourFinder` in favor of well-configured `ActivityTourFinder`
- Introduction of routed_distance (in contrary to Euclidean distance) and vehicle_distance (all distance covered link by link) into the trip analysis. Changed header, e.g. `preceding_purpose` and `following_purpose`, `euclidean_distance`
- Update to *MATSim 12.0*

**1.0.6**

- Set default mode choice rate to 5%
- Set default iterations to 60
- Consolidate validated Île-de-France simulation
- Fix: Updating geotools repository
- Fix: Correct cutting of public transit lines
- Fix: Consider special "parallel link" cases for network route cutting
- Remove bike from Sao Paulo
- Add Los Angeles and San Francisco
- Add possibility to choose modes to RunPopulationRouting
- Bugfix: EnrichedTransitRoutingModule wrote wrong link and facilities in "pt interaction" activities, which lead to problems when cutting the population
- Bugfix: Added non-default estimators for car to SF and LA
- Bugfix: Chnaged utility functions in SF to WTP space
- Added additional constraints in SF (walk and car_passenger)
- Fixed files read for Cost Parameters in LA and SF
- Added new version of sao paulo

**1.0.5**

- Fix transit_walk detection in EqasimMainModeIdentifier

**1.0.4**

- Update Auckland parameters
- Add deployment target for Maven

**1.0.3**

- Add custom MainModeIdentifier
- Bugfix: Shape extent did not cut teleportation trips properly
- Fix analysis interval for trip analysis
- Make AvCostWriter close file on shutdown
- Disable calibration output by default (since reference data is not always available)
- Add iml and idea to gitignore
- Add calibration utilities
- Improve code structure of the choice models in `core` and `switzerland`
- Improve trips analysis with PersonFilter and give access to other modules if present
- Add analysis of trips via config file
- Add better support for command line parameters
- Bugfix: Utility calculation for car/pt did not consider cost
- Add interpolation for AV cost calculation and output
- Add `fleet-size` parameter to Zurich/AV example
- Add `examples` package to demonstrate integration of multiple eqasim modules
- Add `automated_vehicles` package for integration with `av` package version `1.0.0`
- Add trip analysis
- Switch DiscreteModeChoice to version 1.0.7

- Add Sé shape file

**1.0.1**

- Modularize mode choice via injection and configuration

**1.0.0**

- Initial version
