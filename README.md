The `eqasim` package is a collection of ready-to-run high-quality scenarios
for the agent- and activity-based transport simulation framework [MATSim](https://matsim.org/).
This repository contains the Java parts of the project which extend MATSim and
provide functionality to generate the simulation data.

Therefore, this repository has to functions: First, to provide the code to run
`eqasim` simulations (and extend them), second, to act as a dependency for the
various pipelines that generate runnable MATSim scenarios from raw data sets,
such as for:

- [ÃŽle-de-France and Paris](https://github.com/eqasim-org/ile-de-france)
- [California](https://github.com/eqasim-org/california)
- [Sao Paulo](https://github.com/eqasim-org/california)

To understand how to set up a simulation and run it, please refer to the
respective repositories. To cut out smaller parts of existing simulations
check out how to use this repository to [create simulation cut-outs](docs/cutting.md).
